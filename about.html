						<h4 class="fw-bold mb-1">My History</h4>
						<p>
							A breif history of how I got where I am today.
							<h6 class="border-bottom">Childhood</h6>
							<div class="mb-2">
								Originaly I got introduced to programming as an extra curicular class
								in elementary school invovling a "block-placed logic" application to 
								make simple games and programs.
							</div>
							<h6 class="border-bottom">Adolescence</h6>
							<div class="mb-2">
								I took classes in middle-school involving "Blitz3D" and its predecessor "Blitz Basic" to make video-games,
								such as, space invadors and pacman.
							</div>
							<div class="mb-2">
								In high-school I branched out to more languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, 
								there were no classes available for programming beyond what they offered in middle school.
							</div>
							<h6 class="border-bottom">Adulthood</h6>
							<div class="mb-2">
								Even though my family didn't have the money to send me to college I went on federal assistance.
							</div>
							<div class="mb-2">
								I studied a semester of Computer Science, taking Web Design learing HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
								as well as Computer Science LVL 1, using Python and Java. 
							</div>
							<div class="mb-2">
								I was forced to drop out due to finacial reasons then juggled jobs until finally joining the 
								Air Force in 2018.
							</div>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col d-flex align-items-start">
					<div>
						<h4 class="fw-bold mb-0">Current Work</h4>
						<p>
							What am I doing now?
							<h6 class="border-bottom">Self-Teaching</h6>
							<div class="mb-2">
								Since joining the Air Force I have not had time to take any more classes.
								The whole reason I joined the Air Force was for tuition assistance, but,
								the job I got placed in is very busy and I hardly have the free time to take a college level class.
							</div>
							<div class="mb-2">
								So, in the meantime, I have been programming as much as I have time for, learning all I can solo.
								Currently I have been learning C++ by making the skeleton of a game engine and using Microsofts C++ Courses.
								I have also been keeping my HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to good use by taking on fun side projects.
							</div>
							<div>
								You can see one of those side projects by going <a href="https://t-felm-lee.github.io/payitforward">here</a>.
